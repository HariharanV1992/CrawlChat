# 🚀 How CrawlChat Works - Simple Explanation

## 🏗️ **What You Have (Your "CrawlChat Factory")**

Think of your system like a **smart document processing factory** with 3 main workers:

### **👨‍💼 Worker 1: API Service (Lambda)**
- **What it does**: Main reception desk - handles all website requests
- **Where it lives**: AWS Lambda (serverless computer)
- **When it works**: Every time someone visits `crawlchat.site`
- **What it handles**: 
  - User login/registration
  - Chat conversations
  - File uploads
  - Website responses

### **🤖 Worker 2: Crawler Service (Lambda)**
- **What it does**: Web robot - visits websites and collects information
- **Where it lives**: AWS Lambda (serverless computer)
- **When it works**: Only when users ask to crawl websites
- **What it handles**:
  - Visiting websites
  - Extracting text content
  - Saving data to storage

### **📄 Worker 3: Preprocessor Service (ECS)**
- **What it does**: Document converter - turns PDFs into readable text
- **Where it lives**: ECS Fargate (always-running computer)
- ** When it works**: Automatically when PDFs are uploaded
- **What it handles**:
  - PDF text extraction
  - Image processing
  - Document conversion

## 🌐 **How It All Works Together**

```
User visits crawlchat.site
         ↓
    API Service (Lambda)
         ↓
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │ What does user  │
    │ want to do?     │
    └─────────────────┘
         ↓
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │ 1. Chat?        │ → Use OpenAI to respond
    │ 2. Upload PDF?  │ → Send to Preprocessor
    │ 3. Crawl web?   │ → Send to Crawler
    └─────────────────┘
```

## 📦 **Where Everything is Stored (ECR)**

**ECR = Amazon's Private Docker Warehouse**

Your 3 services are packaged as **Docker images** and stored in ECR:

1. **`crawlchat-api`** - API service image
2. **`crawlchat-crawler`** - Crawler service image  
3. **`crawlchat-preprocessor`** - Preprocessor service image

## 🔧 **What You Need to Complete**

### **Missing Pieces:**
1. **Crawler Lambda Function** - Image exists but function not created
2. **ECS Preprocessor Service** - Image exists but service not deployed

### **To Complete Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create crawler function
chmod +x create_crawler_function.sh
./create_crawler_function.sh

# 2. Create preprocessor service  
chmod +x create_preprocessor_service.sh
./create_preprocessor_service.sh
```

## 💰 **Cost Breakdown**

### **Lambda (API + Crawler)**
- **Pay per request** - only when used
- **Very cheap** - ~$0.20 per million requests
- **No cost when idle**

### **ECS (Preprocessor)**
- **Pay per hour** - runs continuously
- **More expensive** - ~$10-20/month
- **Always ready to process PDFs**

### **ECR (Storage)**
- **Pay per GB stored** - very cheap
- **~$0.10 per GB per month**

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### ✅ **Working:**
- Website API (crawlchat.site)
- User authentication
- Chat functionality
- PDF upload (basic)

### ❌ **Missing:**
- Web crawling functionality
- Advanced PDF processing
- Complete 3-service integration

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the setup scripts** to create missing services
2. **Test the complete system** with all 3 services
3. **Monitor performance** and optimize if needed
4. **Scale up** as you get more users

## 🤔 **Why This Architecture?**

### **Lambda (Serverless)**
- **Perfect for**: API calls, web crawling
- **Benefits**: Pay per use, auto-scaling, no server management
- **Use case**: Services that run occasionally

### **ECS (Container Service)**
- **Perfect for**: PDF processing, background tasks
- **Benefits**: Always ready, better for long-running tasks
- **Use case**: Services that need to run continuously

### **ECR (Container Registry)**
- **Perfect for**: Storing your application packages
- **Benefits**: Secure, integrated with AWS services
- **Use case**: Version control for your applications
